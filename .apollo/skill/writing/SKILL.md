# Writing Guidelines

## Before Writing
1. Who is the audience? (developers, users, executives)
2. What's the purpose? (inform, persuade, instruct)
3. What action should reader take after reading?

## Document Structure
```
Title / Header
├── TL;DR / Summary (1-3 sentences)
├── Context / Background (why this exists)
├── Main Content (the meat)
├── Examples (if applicable)
└── Next Steps / Call to Action
```

## Writing Principles

### Clarity
- One idea per paragraph
- Short sentences (max 20 words)
- Active voice over passive
- Specific over vague ("3 files" not "some files")

### Conciseness
- Cut filler: "basically", "actually", "really", "very"
- Remove redundancy: "end result" → "result"
- Get to the point fast
- If a sentence doesn't add value, delete it

### Scannability
- Use headers to organize
- Use bullet points for lists
- Bold key terms
- Keep paragraphs short (3-4 sentences max)

## Technical Writing Specifics

### README Files
1. What is this? (1 sentence)
2. Quick start (get running in <5 min)
3. Installation
4. Usage examples
5. Configuration
6. Contributing

### API Documentation
- Endpoint + method
- Parameters (required/optional)
- Response format
- Example request/response
- Error codes

### Code Comments
- Explain "why", not "what"
- Keep updated with code
- No obvious comments ("// increment i")

## Tone Guidelines
- Professional but not stiff
- Confident but not arrogant
- Helpful but not condescending
- Match the context (casual for internal, formal for external)

## Common Fixes
| Instead of | Write |
|------------|-------|
| "In order to" | "To" |
| "Due to the fact that" | "Because" |
| "At this point in time" | "Now" |
| "It is important to note" | Just state it |
| "Please be advised" | Delete it |

## Before Submitting
1. Read it out loud - does it flow?
2. Can anything be cut?
3. Is the structure clear?
4. Would a new reader understand it?
