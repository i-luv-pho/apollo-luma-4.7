Connects to and queries SQL and NoSQL databases.

Supported databases:
- PostgreSQL (pg)
- MySQL (mysql2)
- SQLite (better-sqlite3)
- MongoDB (mongodb)
- Redis (ioredis)

Actions:

connect - Establish database connection
```
action: "connect"
type: "postgres"
host: "localhost"
port: 5432
database: "mydb"
username: "user"
password: "pass"
name: "main"  # Connection name for reuse
```

Or with connection string:
```
action: "connect"
type: "postgres"
connectionString: "postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb"
```

query - Execute SELECT queries
```
action: "query"
sql: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1"
params: [123]
```

execute - Execute INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
```
action: "execute"
sql: "INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ($1, $2)"
params: ["John", "john@example.com"]
```

schema - Get database structure
```
action: "schema"
table: "users"  # Optional - omit to list all tables
```

mongodb - MongoDB-specific operations
```
action: "mongodb"
collection: "users"
operation: "find"
filter: { "status": "active" }
limit: 10
```

redis - Redis commands
```
action: "redis"
command: "GET"
args: ["mykey"]
```

disconnect - Close connection
```
action: "disconnect"
name: "main"
```

MongoDB operations:
- find, findOne: Query documents
- insertOne, insertMany: Insert documents
- updateOne, updateMany: Update documents
- deleteOne, deleteMany: Delete documents
- count: Count documents
- aggregate: Aggregation pipeline

Redis commands:
- GET, SET, DEL: String operations
- HGET, HSET, HGETALL: Hash operations
- LPUSH, RPUSH, LRANGE: List operations
- SADD, SMEMBERS: Set operations
- ZADD, ZRANGE: Sorted set operations

Notes:
- Connections are cached and reused across tool calls
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Write operations require elevated permissions
- Install required packages: npm install pg mysql2 better-sqlite3 mongodb ioredis
- Store credentials securely using credential name reference
