To debug any issues with Apollo, you can check the logs or the session data
that it stores locally.

---

### Logs

Log files are written to:

- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.local/share/apollo/log/`
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.local\share\apollo\log\`

Log files are named with timestamps (e.g., `2025-01-09T123456.log`) and the most recent 10 log files are kept.

You can set the log level with the `--log-level` command-line option to get more detailed debug information. For example, `apollo --log-level DEBUG`.

---

### Storage

apollo stores session data and other application data on disk at:

- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.local/share/apollo/`
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.local\share\apollo`

This directory contains:

- `auth.json` - Authentication data like API keys, OAuth tokens
- `log/` - Application logs
- `project/` - Project-specific data like session and message data
  - If the project is within a Git repo, it is stored in `./<project-slug>/storage/`
  - If it is not a Git repo, it is stored in `./global/storage/`

## Getting help

If you're experiencing issues with Apollo:

1. **Report issues on GitHub**

   The best way to report bugs or request features is through our GitHub repository:

   [**github.com/metamorphis-labs/apollo/issues**](https://github.com/metamorphis-labs/apollo/issues)

   Before creating a new issue, search existing issues to see if your problem has already been reported.

## Common issues

Here are some common issues and how to resolve them.

---

### Apollo won't start

1. Check the logs for error messages
2. Try running with `--print-logs` to see output in the terminal
3. Ensure you have the latest version with `apollo upgrade`

---

### Authentication issues

1. Try re-authenticating with the `/connect` command in the TUI
2. Check that your API keys are valid
3. Ensure your network allows connections to the provider's API

---

### Model not available

1. Check that you've authenticated with the provider
2. Verify the model name in your config is correct
3. Some models may require specific access or subscriptions

If you encounter `ProviderModelNotFoundError` you are most likely incorrectly
referencing a model somewhere.
Models should be referenced like so: `<providerId>/<modelId>`

Examples:

- `openai/gpt-4.1`
- `openrouter/google/gemini-2.5-flash`
- `apollo/kimi-k2`

To figure out what models you have access to, run `apollo models`

---

### ProviderInitError

If you encounter a ProviderInitError, you likely have an invalid or corrupted configuration.

To resolve this:

1. First, verify your provider is set up correctly by following the [providers guide](/docs/providers)
2. If the issue persists, try clearing your stored configuration:

   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.local/share/apollo
   ```

3. Re-authenticate with your provider using the `/connect` command in the TUI.

---

### AI_APICallError and provider package issues

If you encounter API call errors, this may be due to outdated provider packages. apollo dynamically installs provider packages (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) as needed and caches them locally.

To resolve provider package issues:

1. Clear the provider package cache:

   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.cache/apollo
   ```

2. Restart apollo to reinstall the latest provider packages

This will force apollo to download the most recent versions of provider packages, which often resolves compatibility issues with model parameters and API changes.

### Copy/paste not working on Linux

Linux users need to have one of the following clipboard utilities installed for copy/paste functionality to work:

**For X11 systems:**

```bash
apt install -y xclip
# or
apt install -y xsel
```

**For Wayland systems:**

```bash
apt install -y wl-clipboard
```

**For headless environments:**

```bash
apt install -y xvfb
# and run:
Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1024x768x24 > /dev/null 2>&1 &
export DISPLAY=:99.0
```

apollo will detect if you're using Wayland and prefer `wl-clipboard`, otherwise it will try to find clipboard tools in order of: `xclip` and `xsel`.
