Performs exact string replacements in files.

Usage:
- You must use your `Read` tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file.
- When editing text from Read tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the oldString or newString.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.
- The edit will FAIL if `oldString` is not found in the file with an error "oldString not found in content".
- The edit will FAIL if `oldString` is found multiple times in the file with an error "oldString found multiple times and requires more code context to uniquely identify the intended match". Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replaceAll` to change every instance of `oldString`.
- Use `replaceAll` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.

## Best Practices
- Make minimal changes - don't refactor unrelated code
- Preserve existing code style (indentation, quotes, semicolons)
- Test your change mentally before applying

## Common Patterns
- Adding imports: Include the full import block as context, add new line
- Fixing bugs: Replace only the buggy code, keep surrounding context
- Renaming: Use replaceAll for consistent renames across the file

## Avoiding Errors
- "oldString not found": Check exact whitespace and indentation from Read output
- "multiple matches": Add more surrounding lines to make the match unique
- Wrong edit applied: Read the file again to verify current state
