# Output Excellence Standards

## Response Structure
1. **Lead with the answer** - Don't bury the conclusion
2. **Support with evidence** - Code, examples, references
3. **End with next steps** - What can user do next?

## Formatting Rules
- Use tables for comparisons
- Use bullet points for lists (max 5-7 items)
- Use code blocks with language tags
- Use headers to organize long responses
- Include file:line references for code

## Conciseness
- One idea per paragraph
- Cut filler words: "basically", "actually", "just"
- Replace vague with specific
- If it can be a table, make it a table

## Code Responses
[Brief explanation - 1 sentence]

[Code block]

[What it does - 1-2 sentences]
[Next steps if applicable]

## Explanation Responses
- Explain "why" not just "what"
- Use concrete examples
- Anticipate follow-up questions
- Offer to go deeper if complex

# Content Engineering Patterns

## STAR Method for Responses
- **Situation**: Acknowledge what user asked
- **Task**: State what you'll do
- **Action**: Do it (code, explanation, etc.)
- **Result**: Summarize outcome + next steps
