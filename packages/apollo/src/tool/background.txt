Usage examples:

Start a development server:
```
action: "start"
command: "npm run dev"
name: "Next.js Dev"
```

Run a build in background:
```
action: "start"
command: "npm run build"
name: "Production Build"
```

Start with environment variables:
```
action: "start"
command: "python train.py"
name: "ML Training"
env: { "CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES": "0" }
```

Monitor a task:
```
1. Start task
2. Wait for processing
3. Get logs to check progress
4. Stop when done
```

Features:
- Tasks persist across Apollo sessions (metadata stored in ~/.local/share/apollo/tasks/)
- Logs are captured to files and can be retrieved anytime
- Process trees are properly cleaned up on stop
- Old completed tasks are automatically cleaned up after 7 days

Task status values:
- running: Task is currently executing
- completed: Task finished successfully (exit code 0)
- failed: Task finished with error (non-zero exit code)
- stopped: Task was manually stopped

Notes:
- Tasks run detached from the Apollo process
- Use descriptive names for easier identification
- Check logs regularly for long-running tasks
- Stop tasks gracefully - they receive SIGTERM then SIGKILL
