Manages cloud infrastructure on AWS, GCP, and Azure.

AWS S3 (Object Storage):
```
provider: "aws", service: "s3", action: "list-buckets"
provider: "aws", service: "s3", action: "list", bucket: "my-bucket", prefix: "data/"
provider: "aws", service: "s3", action: "get", bucket: "my-bucket", key: "file.txt"
provider: "aws", service: "s3", action: "put", bucket: "my-bucket", key: "file.txt", body: "content"
provider: "aws", service: "s3", action: "delete", bucket: "my-bucket", key: "file.txt"
```

AWS EC2 (Compute):
```
provider: "aws", service: "ec2", action: "list"
provider: "aws", service: "ec2", action: "describe", instanceId: "i-1234567890abcdef0"
provider: "aws", service: "ec2", action: "start", instanceId: "i-1234567890abcdef0"
provider: "aws", service: "ec2", action: "stop", instanceId: "i-1234567890abcdef0"
```

AWS Lambda (Serverless):
```
provider: "aws", service: "lambda", action: "list"
provider: "aws", service: "lambda", action: "describe", functionName: "my-function"
provider: "aws", service: "lambda", action: "invoke", functionName: "my-function", payload: { "key": "value" }
```

GCP Storage:
```
provider: "gcp", service: "storage", action: "list-buckets"
provider: "gcp", service: "storage", action: "list", bucket: "my-bucket"
provider: "gcp", service: "storage", action: "get", bucket: "my-bucket", object: "file.txt"
provider: "gcp", service: "storage", action: "put", bucket: "my-bucket", object: "file.txt", content: "data"
provider: "gcp", service: "storage", action: "delete", bucket: "my-bucket", object: "file.txt"
```

Authentication:

AWS credentials are loaded from:
1. Stored credential (credentialName parameter)
2. Environment variables (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)
3. AWS credentials file (~/.aws/credentials)
4. IAM instance role

GCP credentials are loaded from:
1. GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable
2. Default application credentials (gcloud auth application-default login)
3. Service account attached to compute instance

Storing AWS credentials:
```
# Use the credentials tool to store AWS keys
credential name: "aws-prod"
type: "aws"
accessKeyId: "AKIA..."
secretAccessKey: "..."
region: "us-east-1"
```

Permission levels:
- cloud: Read-only operations (list, get, describe)
- cloud_write: Modify operations (put, start, stop, invoke)
- cloud_delete: Destructive operations (delete, terminate)

Required packages:
- AWS: @aws-sdk/client-s3, @aws-sdk/client-ec2, @aws-sdk/client-lambda
- GCP: @google-cloud/storage

Notes:
- Azure support coming soon
- Use region parameter to specify AWS region (default: us-east-1)
- GCP uses default project from credentials
- All operations respect IAM permissions
